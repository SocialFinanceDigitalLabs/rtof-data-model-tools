# Using the Shared Data System
This page explains the system that has been created to allow providers to submit, validate and download data. 

The system is hosted through individual MS Teams sites. Each provider that requires the ability to upload and download data will be provided an MS Teams site, with access given to those that need it. Access requests for log-in details must be approved by the Home Office.

The MS Teams site gives access to four key folders:

### 1. Upload - *drop all data files to be submitted here* 
### 2  Reports - *view all validation reports on previous uploads here*  
### 3. Data - *view the current 'live' dataset here*
### 4. Archive - *view all previous datasets here*  

# Basic principles of uploads

* All providers will need to capture their data using the common data model outlined in [record tab]({{ '/Records' | relative_url }}) of this webpage.
* All data submissions will be on an individual level, not aggregates.
* Data submission uploads to the system must occur on a monthly basis, following the schedule outlined by Palladium, see below for details. 


# Proposed data upload schedule

Data can be submitted into the system at any time during the month. 

Palladium have outlined that all data collected, that relates to the previous month, must be submitted into the system by 14th day of the following month. 

On the 14th day of the month, the submitted data will become available for all other stakeholders to download,  enabling performance management, evaluation and learning aspects of the fund to be delivered.
